IndoorDB
========

This is one of the Android applications used for indoor navigation in a situation where infrastructure like WiFi is not working. Basically,
this application is used to set up a location database which will be used by another Android application. 
In this application, we take the Knowles Building of University of Massachusetts Amherst as an example. The blueprint of the Knowles Building is 
overlaid on the google map. We use this overlay to add reference points with their location data in the form of latitude and longitude to 
local database by clicking on the screen. 
 
In order to make it convenient for people to check out the application, the login session is not added in this application. But
in practice, only authorized users can use this application to update the data in the database.
